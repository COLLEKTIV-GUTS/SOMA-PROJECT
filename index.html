            <p><i>Guising</i>, or dressing up on Halloween, has long been a tradition in which members of the community
                dress up as corpses to enact a danse macabre, or “dance of death”, reminding the community of death’s
                ubiquity and universality.
            </p>
            <p>This weekend, in response to recent policy changes surrounding abortion rights and the emergence of more
                restrictions on bodily autonomy, we want to expose the UNFREE BODY. Subject to remote forms of control,
                the body experiences a kind of living death. It becomes a puppet - zombified, mummified, corpse-like.
            </p>
            <p>We don’t want to dress up for Halloween - or maybe we do, but let’s face true horror: without autonomy
                over our own bodies, we are already the living dead. We want to focus on the body itself. On its freedom
                and its potential to lose that freedom - its potential as a corpse. Together, let’s draw attention to
                the fragility of the flesh that separates the living from the dead.
            </p>
            <p><b>HOW</b>: We invite you to take part in an ambitious project and be the change you want to see in the
                world! We are looking for a collective yet autonomous creative response not only to Halloween, but to
                the deathly currents of the times we are living in. Be part of the making-process within a greater
                story, as great as you can make it, by taking it up on you to share this with all the communities you
                are part of.
            </p>
            <p><b>RESPONSE 1</b><br>Choose an image, sentence or quote which speaks to the idea of the UNFREE BODY.
                This could also mean printing an article, a title of a book, a text message- BE INNOVATIVE.
                <br>We as a collective would love for everyone to put these onto body clothing ( t-shirts- costumes-
                PJs- anything you’re planning on wearing) - print them, sew them, glue them in whatever way you like -
                and stage an intervention at your Halloween celebrations (or at any other time this weekend- if you’re
                staying in bed to eat all the ‘trick or treat’ candy yourself that's ok too, as long as you respond!).
            </p>
            <p><b>RESPONSE 2</b><br>Work directly onto your body. We love to see the flesh ;)
                Draw something onto yourself? Use body gestures?
            </p>
            <p><b>MOST IMPORTANTLY- DOCUMENT YOUR CONTRIBUTION!</b><br>Send us a photograph through <a
                    href="mailto:SOMA.PROJECT.COLLECTIVE@gmail.com">email</a> by Monday 31st 2pm UK time
                We will present the compilation of photographs as a single artwork that will be brought back on this
                platform, showing how the world can come together in revolution over only one Halloween weekend! <br>**
                from the 7th of November onwards</p>
            <p>Art can and should change the world, and we are neither alone nor incapable of doing it.
            </p>
            <p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b><br>This project and platform have been launched in the past 10 (nocturnal) hours in a
                collective approach. if you think you have valuable material, from news to happenings to readings of all
                sorts on BODY AUTONOMY please share them with us through email at <a
                    href="mailto:SOMA.PROJECT.COLLECTIVE@gmai.com">SOMA.PROJECT.COLLECTIVE@gmai.com</a>. This will keep
                the platform as alive and rich as it can be. Thank you for your precious contribution.

                <b>BODY AUTONOMY DEFINITION</b>:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choosing how you dress and express yourself,</li>
                    <li>Choosing who and how you love,</li>
                    <li>Taking decisions related to your health and wellbeing</li>
                </ul>
                The foundational principle of body autonomy is universality and equality. Body autonomy is a concept
                that applies to everyone, regardless of their gender, sexuality or body!
